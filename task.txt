First things first,
We set up the backend of our app to connect to the database.
Installing express and other dependencies so we can keep track faster and easier I used nodemon.
To test the port or ports we will set by using a .env file. 

I was using postman to test out any routes I created for the API for the POST, GET, etc
which I then set the functions for them in the code inside of the controllers file that assign to each route rather then bloating them in the routes themself as it would create mess in the file as we want to make it more readable,

I then added mongoose to connect to our MongoDB database and created the models on which data to accept for each property type.
we then pass the data through the GET function of the routes to test if we see any data come through as the body.

once confirmed we then pass the data throgh as a DataGrid (Table) to assign each value into a column with the correct data assigned to the row's. 
Also creating a form for input data to be POST requested into the table. While also setting the states (Provider) to wrap around the App component so we can manage it 
better for the UX.
